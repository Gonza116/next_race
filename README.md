# next_race
A super simple api that tells you when the next race happens

It is built on Spring Boot, Maven and Tomcat. Basically, it consumes a json with all the races in this year's calendar, then returns the closest one.
Right now this only supports F1 (.../api/f1/next). I may add some more later.

Made with <3 for an otter.
